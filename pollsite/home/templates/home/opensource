        <h1>Open Source</h1>
        <h3>Several fantastic pieces of free and open-source programming languages and frameworks have
            really helped get me do what I did like this web Application.
            As I enjoy giving credit where it's due, I included the entire list below.
            This means you can not only see which programming language / framework / tools / libraries
            I've been using, but the terms of the licenses too.
            A big thanks from the depth of my heart to all the smart people behind the fantastic stuff
            listed. Rock on!</h3>
